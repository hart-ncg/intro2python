Scripts for the Digitial Methods module: Introduction to coding

To get started on this module, you will need to install python and a few modules. Follow these steps to set up the necessary python environment.

(a) Navigate to https://conda.io/miniconda.html and download the appropriate Miniconda installer for your operating system. Most modern laptops require the 64-bit version. Double click on the downloader install and install following the default settings.

(b) Your Start menu (or similar or Mac or Linux), should now have a program called conda prompt. Double click on this and a console screen will appear.

(c) We can now install the final few things needed by typing this command in the conda prompt window: conda install numpy, matplotlib, spyder
Type “y” when asked to proceed with installation.

(d) Close the conda prompt window. You should now have a program called Spyder available in your start menu. Spyder provides a good graphical interface to Python and will allow you to open the river catchment model and make modifications to the variables.
